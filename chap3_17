/*(Game: scissor, rock, paper) Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rockpaper
game. (A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can
wrap a rock.) The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing
scissor, rock, and paper. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or
2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses,
or draws. Here are sample runs:*/
